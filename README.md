# passwordGenerator1
This code runs a program that generates a random password for a user based on the information fed into the system.
the user would be asked what app the password is for and how long they would like the password to be.
putting this information through various steps like reverse, as well as replacing some characters, a password would be generated.
if the number of characters in the app name does not match the number of characters desired by the user for their password
zeros would be amended to reach the desired number of characters
