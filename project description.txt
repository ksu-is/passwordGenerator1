password generator:

user will input name of the application and
the length(atleast 8) of the password to be generated.

problem: 
passwords are a pain to remember, too many emails and platforms
having the same password is not safe
but having a different one for all would be easy to forget
examples: D2L, facebook, instagram, twitter

solution:
generates passwords based on user input 
the password include 1 special character, 1 upper case character
atleast 8 characters, and 1 number.


password_gen = accepts string

------------------
✔️reverse the word 
✔️first char = U_case
✔️replace a = @
✔️replace o = 0
✔️every 5th char = #
✔️if length of app is less than 8, duplicate 
✔️if length of app name is less than 8, we duplicate atleast once.
we add 0s to meet up with the user's desired length.
